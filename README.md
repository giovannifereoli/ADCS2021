# ADCS2021
Spacecraft Attitude Determination and Control 

During this project we designed the ADCS system of a 12U Cubesat and simulated de-tumbling, slew maneuvering and tracking phases. The requirements were: Euler angles for kinematics, gyroscopes as sensors and 3 reaction wheels as actuators. We have modeled also star trackers (needed for the attitude determination) and thrusters (for de-saturate reaction wheels during tracking phase and for other maneuvres). We designed also the controller for satisfy all the requirements.
